    <h1>What is internet security?</h1>
    <p>Internet security are all those precautions that are taken to protect all the elements that are part of the network, such as infrastructure and information, which is usually the most affected by cyber criminals.</p>
    <p>Computer security is responsible for creating methods, procedures and standards that are able to identify and eliminate vulnerabilities in information and physical equipment, such as computers.</p>
    <p>This type of security has databases, files and equipment that prevent important information from falling into the hands of the wrong people.</p>
    <p>One of the best ways to stay protected on the internet is through antivirus, to understand them much better, enter our course on computer viruses and antivirus.</p>
    <h2>Difference between passive and active security threats</h2>
    <p>Active and Passive Attacks are security attacks. In Active attack, an attacker tries to modify the content of the messages. Whereas in Passive attack, an attacker observes the messages, copy them and may use them for malicious purposes.</p>

<p>Following are the important differences between Active Attack and Passive Attack</p>

<li>Modification:	In Active Attack, information is modified.	In Passive Attack, information remain unchanged.</li>
<li>Dangerous For:	Active Attack is dangerous for Integrity as well as Availability.	Passive Attack is dangerous for Confidentiality.</li>
<li>Attention:	Attention is to be paid on detection.	Attention is to be paid on prevention.</li>
<li>Impact on System:	In Active Attack, system is damaged.	In Passive Attack, system has no impact.</li>
<li>Victim:	Victim gets informed in active attack.	Victim does not get informed in passive attack.</li>
<li>System Resources:	System Resources can be changed in active attack.	System Resources are not changed in passive attack.</li>
<h3>Malware</h3>
<p>"Malware" is short for malicious software and used as a single term to refer to virus, spy ware, worm etc. Malware is designed to cause damage to a stand-alone computer or a networked pc. So wherever a malware term is used it means a program which is designed to damage your computer it may be a virus, worm or Trojan.</p>
<p><strong>Worms</strong></p>
<p>Worms are malicious programs that make copies of themselves again and again on the local drive, network shares, etc. The only purpose of the worm is to reproduce itself again and again. It doesn’t harm any data/file on the computer. Unlike a virus, it does not need to attach itself to an existing program. Worms spread by exploiting vulnerabilities in operating systems. Examples of worm are: W32.SillyFDC.BBY, Packed.Generic.236, W32.Troresba.</p>
<p><strong>Trojans</strong></p>
<p>A Trojan horse is not a virus. It is a destructive program that looks as a genuine application. Unlike viruses, Trojan horses do not replicate themselves but they can be just as destructive. Trojans also open a backdoor entry to your computer which gives malicious users/programs access to your system, allowing confidential and personal information to be theft. Example: - JS.Debeski.Trojan.</p>
<p><strong>Virus</strong></p>
<p>Virus is a program written to enter to your computer and damage/alter your files/data. A virus might corrupt or delete data on your computer. Viruses can also replicate themselves. A computer Virus is more dangerous than a computer worm as it makes changes or deletes your files while worms only replicates itself with out making changes to your files/data. Examples of virus are: W32.Sfc!mod, ABAP.Rivpas.A, Accept.3773</p>
<p><strong>Spyware</strong></p>
<p>Spyware is a type of program that is installed with or without your permission on your personal computers to collect information about users, their computer or browsing habits tracks each and everything that you do without your knowledge and send it to remote user. It also can download other malicious programs from internet and install it on the computer.Spyware works like adware but is usually a separate program that is installed unknowingly when you install another freeware type program or application.</p>
<h4>What is Network Security?</h4>
<p>Network security is any practice or tool designed and implemented to secure a network and its data. It includes software, hardware, and cloud solutions. Effective network security tools stop a wide range of cyberattacks, and prevent attacks spreading throughout the network in case of a data breach.</p>
<p>To deter cyberattacks and hacking attempts, a total of two types of network security components can be called upon – <strong>hardwares</strong> and <strong>software</strong>.</p>
    To deter cyberattacks and hacking attempts, a total of three types of network security components can be called upon – hardware, software, and cloud security components.
<p>Hardware components include servers and devices that perform an array of security operations within a network. Hardware components can be set up in two ways:</p>
<li>Out of the path of network traffic (“out-of-line”): Operating as a separate entity from network traffic, out-of-line security appliances are tasked with monitoring traffic and raising alerts when they detect malicious data.</li>
<li>In the path of network traffic (“in-line”): A more popular option of the two, in-line hardware appliances are tasked with directly blocking data packets the moment they run into potential threats.</li>
<p>Security software components are installed on devices across the network, providing added detection capabilities and threat remediation. The far most common form of software network security components are antivirus applications.</p>
<h5>Network protocols</h5>
<p>Network protocols are a set of rules, conventions, and data structures that dictate how devices exchange data across networks. In other words, network protocols can be equated to languages that two devices must understand for seamless communication of information, regardless of their infrastructure and design disparities.</p>
<p><strong>HTTP: Hyper Text Transfer Protocol</strong></p>
<p>HTTP is an application layer protocol used for distributed, collaborative, and hypermedia information systems. It works on a client-server model, where the web browser acts as the client. Data such as text, images, and other multimedia files are shared over the World Wide Web using HTTP. As a request and response type protocol, the client sends a request to the server, which is then processed by the server before sending a response back to the client.</p>

<p>HTTP is a stateless protocol, meaning the client and server are only aware of each other while the connection between them is intact. After that, both the client and server forget about each other's existence. Due to this phenomenon, the client and server can't both retain information between requests.</p>
<p><strong>IPv6: Internet Protocol version 6</strong><p>
    <p>IPv6 is the latest version of the Internet Protocol, a network layer protocol that possesses addressing and control information for enabling packets to be routed in the network. IPv6 was created to deal with IPv4 exhaustion. It increases the IP address size from 32 bits to 128 bits to support more levels of addressing.</p>
    <h6>Digital Certificates and Certificate Authority</h6>
    <p>Digital certificates are electronic credentials that are used to assert the online identities of individuals, computers, and other entities on a network. Digital certificates function similarly to identification cards such as passports and drivers licenses. Most commonly they contain a public key and the identity of the owner. They are issued by certification authorities (CAs) that must validate the identity of the certificate-holder both before the certificate is issued and when the certificate is used. Common uses include business scenarios requiring authentication, encryption, and digital signing. </p>
    <p>A Certificate Authority (CA) issues digital certificates that contain a public key and the identity of the owner. The matching private key is not made available publicly, but kept secret by the end user who generated the key pair. The certificate is also a confirmation or validation by the CA that the public key contained in the certificate belongs to the person, organization, server or other entity noted in the certificate. A CA's obligation in such schemes is to verify an applicant's credentials, so that users and relying parties can trust the information in the CA's certificates. CAs use a variety of standards and tests to do so. In essence, the Certificate Authority is responsible for saying "yes, this person is who they say they are, and we, the CA, verify that".
If the user trusts the CA and can verify the CA's signature, then he can also verify that a certain public key does indeed belong to whoever is identified in the certificate. Browsers maintain list of well known CAs root certificates.  Aside from commercial CAs, some providers issue digital certificates to the public at no cost. Large institutions or government entities may have their own CAs.
