    <h1>What is internet security?</h1>
    <p>Internet security are all those precautions that are taken to protect all the elements that are part of the network, such as infrastructure and information, which is usually the most affected by cyber criminals.</p>
    <p>Computer security is responsible for creating methods, procedures and standards that are able to identify and eliminate vulnerabilities in information and physical equipment, such as computers.</p>
    <p>This type of security has databases, files and equipment that prevent important information from falling into the hands of the wrong people.</p>
    <p>One of the best ways to stay protected on the internet is through antivirus, to understand them much better, enter our course on computer viruses and antivirus.</p>
    <h2>Difference between passive and active security threats</h2>
    <p>Active and Passive Attacks are security attacks. In Active attack, an attacker tries to modify the content of the messages. Whereas in Passive attack, an attacker observes the messages, copy them and may use them for malicious purposes.</p>

<p>Following are the important differences between Active Attack and Passive Attack</p>

<li>Modification:	In Active Attack, information is modified.	In Passive Attack, information remain unchanged.</li>
<li>Dangerous For:	Active Attack is dangerous for Integrity as well as Availability.	Passive Attack is dangerous for Confidentiality.</li>
<li>Attention:	Attention is to be paid on detection.	Attention is to be paid on prevention.</li>
<li>Impact on System:	In Active Attack, system is damaged.	In Passive Attack, system has no impact.</li>
<li>Victim:	Victim gets informed in active attack.	Victim does not get informed in passive attack.</li>
<li>System Resources:	System Resources can be changed in active attack.	System Resources are not changed in passive attack.</li>
<h3>Malware</h3>
<p>"Malware" is short for malicious software and used as a single term to refer to virus, spy ware, worm etc. Malware is designed to cause damage to a stand-alone computer or a networked pc. So wherever a malware term is used it means a program which is designed to damage your computer it may be a virus, worm or Trojan.</p>
<p><strong>Worms</strong></p>
<p>Worms are malicious programs that make copies of themselves again and again on the local drive, network shares, etc. The only purpose of the worm is to reproduce itself again and again. It doesnâ€™t harm any data/file on the computer. Unlike a virus, it does not need to attach itself to an existing program. Worms spread by exploiting vulnerabilities in operating systems. Examples of worm are: W32.SillyFDC.BBY, Packed.Generic.236, W32.Troresba.</p>
<p><strong>Trojans</strong></p>
<p>A Trojan horse is not a virus. It is a destructive program that looks as a genuine application. Unlike viruses, Trojan horses do not replicate themselves but they can be just as destructive. Trojans also open a backdoor entry to your computer which gives malicious users/programs access to your system, allowing confidential and personal information to be theft. Example: - JS.Debeski.Trojan.</p>
<p><strong>Virus</strong></p>
<p>Virus is a program written to enter to your computer and damage/alter your files/data. A virus might corrupt or delete data on your computer. Viruses can also replicate themselves. A computer Virus is more dangerous than a computer worm as it makes changes or deletes your files while worms only replicates itself with out making changes to your files/data. Examples of virus are: W32.Sfc!mod, ABAP.Rivpas.A, Accept.3773</p>
<p><strong>Spyware</strong></p>
<p>Spyware is a type of program that is installed with or without your permission on your personal computers to collect information about users, their computer or browsing habits tracks each and everything that you do without your knowledge and send it to remote user. It also can download other malicious programs from internet and install it on the computer.Spyware works like adware but is usually a separate program that is installed unknowingly when you install another freeware type program or application.</p>
