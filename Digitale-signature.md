  <h1>What is a digitale signature?</h1>
  <p>The digital signature, in Spain electronic DNI, is a document issued by the General Directorate of the Police (Ministry of the Interior). In addition to physically proving the personal identity of its owner, it allows:</p>
  <li><strong>Electronically and unequivocally prove your identity.</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Digitally sign electronic documents, granting them a legal validity equivalent to that provided by the handwritten signature.</strong></li>
  <p>The DNIe incorporates a small integrated circuit (<strong>chip</strong>), which contains the same data that appears printed on the card (personal data, photograph, digitized signature and digitized fingerprint) together with the <strong>Authentication and Electronic Signature certificates.</strong></p>
  <p>In this way, anyone will be able to carry out multiple online transactions safely with Public Administrations, with public and private companies, and with other citizens, at any time and without having to move or queue.</p>
  <h2>Obtaining the DNIe</h2>
  <p>To obtain the DNIe you must go to an Electronic DNI Issuance Office, pay the established fee and present the following documents:</p>
  <li>Literal birth certificate issued by the corresponding Civil Registry.</li>
  <li>A recent photograph.</li>
  <li>Certificate or registration flyer from the City Council.</li>
  <li>Spaniards residing abroad will prove their domicile by means of a certification from the Diplomatic or Consular Representation where they are registered as residents.</li>
  <p>The obtaining process is described in more detail on the National Police Corps page.</p>
